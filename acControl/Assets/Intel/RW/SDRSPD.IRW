03 = Number of row addresses (includes Mixed-size Row addr) This field describes the Row addressing on the module. If there is one physical bank on the module or if there are two physical banks of the same size and organization, then bits 0-3 are used to represent the number of row addresses for each physical bank. If the module has two physical banks of asymmetric size, then bits 0-3 represent the number of row addresses for physical bank 1 and bits 4-7 represent the number of row addresses for physical bank 2 (bank 2 device is 2x bank 1 device width).
